# Whisky Wallpaper

> A free, native macOS animated-wallpaper engine. Plays 4K videos behind your desktop icons. Rotates through a folder of wallpapers on a timer. No subscription, no account, no telemetry — just AVFoundation + AppKit talking to your Mac directly.

## What it does

- Plays a `.mp4` / `.mov` / `.m4v` as your **desktop wallpaper**, behind your icons
- **One wallpaper per file**, or **rotate** through a folder every 5 / 10 / 30 minutes
- **All displays** at once — one borderless `NSWindow` per `NSScreen`, auto-rebuilds on plug/unplug
- **Loops seamlessly** via `AVPlayerLooper` (no black frame at the loop point)
- **Pauses on sleep**, resumes on wake automatically
- **Login Item** — survives reboots without any extra setup
- **Click-through** — `ignoresMouseEvents = true` so your desktop icons stay clickable
- Sits in the **menu bar** as a `✨` sparkles icon — no Dock noise, no taskbar clutter

## Why it exists

[Backdrop](https://cindori.com/backdrop) by Cindori is a beautifully-built macOS animated wallpaper app — but it's subscription-priced. The actual engine is ~625 lines of straightforward Swift talking to public AVFoundation and AppKit APIs. Whisky Wallpaper is that engine, free and open.

If you're already paying for Backdrop and happy with it, keep it — they earned that money. This is for people who want the same experience without the subscription, who prefer FOSS, or who want a starting point to build something custom.

## Install

### Pre-built (recommended)

Download the latest `Whisky.Wallpaper.app.zip` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ForceAI-KW/whisky-wallpaper/releases), unzip, and drag to `/Applications`.

First launch: right-click → Open (macOS Gatekeeper will warn — the binary is self-signed, not Developer-ID signed). After the first allow, future launches are unblocked.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ForceAI-KW/whisky-wallpaper.git
cd whisky-wallpaper
./scripts/install.sh
```

The script: builds Release, signs with a stable self-signed certificate if one is installed in your login keychain (named `Ahmad Sharaf Code Signing` by default — rename in `scripts/install.sh` to match your cert) — otherwise falls back to ad-hoc. Then installs to `/Applications/Whisky Wallpaper.app`, registers the app as a Login Item, launches it. Idempotent — safe to re-run.

**Stable signing & TCC grants (v1.2.0+):** ad-hoc signatures change every build, so any TCC permissions you've granted (AppleEvents, Accessibility, etc.) get invalidated on every reinstall. Drop a stable self-signed certificate into your login keychain and the installer will use it instead — the binary's Designated Requirement stays constant across rebuilds, so grants persist forever. The installer also detects a change of signing identity vs the previously-installed copy and calls `tccutil reset` only when needed, so you get one clean round of prompts when migrating.

You'll need Xcode (or the Command Line Tools) installed.

## Use

1. Drop video files into `~/Downloads/` — `.mp4` / `.mov` / `.m4v`. 4K H.264 60fps clips are ideal. Free 4K sources:
   - [MoeWalls](https://moewalls.com) — free, no signup, direct download
   - [MyLiveWallpapers](https://mylivewallpapers.com) — same
   - [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/videos) — free, broader variety
2. Click the `✨` icon in your menu bar.
3. Pick a file via **"Pick wallpaper file…"** OR let the app auto-pick the largest video in your folder.
4. Optional: **Rotation → Every 5 / 10 / 30 minutes** to cycle through everything in the folder.

That's it.

### Menu structure

```
✨  Now playing: Astronaut Facing Black Hole

    Reveal in Finder
    Lock-screen sync: On           ⌘L
    ──────────────────────────
    Quit Whisky Wallpaper          ⌘Q
```

The menu live-updates: now-playing title, next-rotation countdown, the active-rotation checkmark, the active-playlist checkmark.

## Privacy

- **No network calls**, ever. The binary links `AppKit`, `AVFoundation`, `ServiceManagement`, `UniformTypeIdentifiers`, and Apple's private `Wallpaper.framework` (for lock-screen sync). No analytics SDK, no telemetry, no auto-updater, no remote config.
- **No account.** It doesn't know who you are.
- **No file uploads.** Videos play from local disk via a security-scoped bookmark stored in `UserDefaults`.

## Architecture

Seven Swift files. Desktop rendering uses only public macOS APIs. Lock-screen sync links Apple's private `Wallpaper.framework` (see Privacy and Requirements below).

```
WhiskyWallpaper/
├── WhiskyWallpaperApp.swift          @main entry, hands off to AppDelegate
├── AppDelegate.swift                 NSStatusItem menu, first-run, Login Item, activateWallpaper coordinator
├── SettingsManager.swift             UserDefaults + security-scoped bookmarks + isLockScreenSyncEnabled
├── PlaylistManager.swift             folder scan + rotation timer
├── WallpaperPlayer.swift             AVQueuePlayer + AVPlayerLooper, sleep/wake observers
├── WallpaperWindowController.swift   one NSWindow per NSScreen at kCGDesktopWindowLevel
├── AerialInstaller.swift             stages video as system aerial in ~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.wallpaper/aerials/
└── WallpaperBridge.swift             private Wallpaper.framework bridge via @_silgen_name
```

### Key technical choices

- **`AVPlayerLooper`** for the loop — seamless transitions vs. the naive `seek(.zero)` approach which shows a black frame between iterations.
- **One `AVQueuePlayer` for all displays** — frames stay synced across monitors; AVPlayer drives multiple layers from a single decode pipeline.
- **`NSWindow.Level(rawValue: Int(CGWindowLevelForKey(.desktopWindow)))`** — sits behind desktop icons. Re-applied after `orderFront()` because AppKit sometimes pulls borderless windows up on first show.
- **`collectionBehavior: [.canJoinAllSpaces, .stationary, .ignoresCycle, .fullScreenNone]`** — shown on every Space, doesn't slide on Mission Control, skipped by Cmd-` window cycle.
- **`ignoresMouseEvents = true`** — desktop icon clicks pass through.
- **`NSApplication.didChangeScreenParametersNotification`** — tears down + rebuilds wallpaper windows on monitor plug/unplug.
- **`NSWorkspace.willSleepNotification` / `.didWakeNotification`** — pauses AVPlayer on sleep, resumes on wake unless user explicitly paused.

### Setting your own default folder

In `AppDelegate.applicationDidFinishLaunching`, first-run picks the **largest** video in `~/Downloads/` — 4K wallpapers from MoeWalls / Pixabay / etc. are typically 50-150MB which biases the pick toward "the thing the user just downloaded for this app." If you keep wallpapers somewhere else, switch via **Pick wallpaper folder…**.

## What it doesn't do

- **Fully-animated lock-screen video.** v2 ships a partial solution: `AerialInstaller` registers the active video in System Settings → Wallpaper so you can activate it end-to-end via Apple's signed UI; `WallpaperBridge` sets a matching still-frame PNG as the system static wallpaper so the lock screen visually matches the desktop. What remains unimplemented is _automatic_ aerial activation via Apple's private `WallpaperSettingsManager` XPC interface (Backdrop uses this Cindori Developer ID-signed path). Toggle the partial solution via **Lock-screen sync: On/Off** (⌘L).
- **In-app browsing of online wallpaper libraries.** Whisky Wallpaper plays files you already have. Use MoeWalls / Pixabay / your own DSLR clips to source them.
- **Per-display different wallpapers.** All displays mirror the same video. Could be added — not currently a goal.
- **Touch-bar shenanigans, widgets, control-center plugins.** Just a wallpaper engine.

## Requirements

- **macOS 26** (Tahoe) or later
- A reasonably modern Mac (any Apple Silicon, or Intel Mac with hardware H.264 decode)
- **No** Apple Developer account needed — Whisky Wallpaper ships self-signed (stable cert if you have one in your keychain, else ad-hoc)
- **No** Backdrop / other wallpaper app needed running — uninstall those first to avoid double-wallpaper situations
- **Footprint note:** the entitlements plist is empty (unsandboxed), but the app links Apple's private `Wallpaper.framework` and writes video copies, PNG thumbnails, and metadata to `~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.wallpaper/aerials/` when lock-screen sync is enabled (default On). See SECURITY.md for details.

## Uninstall

```bash
./scripts/uninstall.sh
```

Removes the app, the Login Item, and all `UserDefaults` traces under `com.ahmadsharaf.WhiskyWallpaper`. Your video files stay where they are.
